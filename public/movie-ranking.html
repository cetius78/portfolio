<h1>My Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>Below are my top 3 favorite movies of all-time (in alphabetical order, may not reflect my opinion on their quality)</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Breakfast Club</h3>
<p>The nostalgia is strong on this one, but it is one of the few movies that I can truly say influenced me in (mostly) positive ways.</p>
<h3>The Princess Bride</h3>
<p>There's a shortage of perfect movies in this world--this is one of them.</p>
<h3>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</h3>
<p>In this case, it's less about the movie and more about its affect on my social life and college experience.</p>
